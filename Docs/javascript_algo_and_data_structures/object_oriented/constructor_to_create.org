#+title: Use a Constructor to Create Objects

* Here's the Bird constructor from the previous challenge:

#+begin_SRC javascript options

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color  = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let blueBird = new Bird();

#+end_SRC


NOTE: this inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.

Notice that the new operator is being used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Bird called blueBird. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now blueBird has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor:


#+begin_SRC javascript

blueBird.name;
blueBird.color;
blueBird.numLegs;

#+end_SRC

Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:

#+begin_SRC javascript

blueBird.name = 'Elvira';
blueBird.name;

#+end_SRC




* Use the Dog constructor from the last lesson to create a new instance of Dog, assigning it to a variable hound.

* CODE:

#+begin_src javascript

function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Only change code below this line

let hound = new Dog();

#+end_src
