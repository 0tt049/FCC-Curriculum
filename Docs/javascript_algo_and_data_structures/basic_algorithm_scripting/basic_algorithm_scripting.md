# Basic Algorithm Scripting

An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.

To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.
